# Case D: Three extern workspaces are imported under the same name, and there is
# a load() statement at the top of the workspace. The repositories are imported
# from tar balls with an http_archive() rule. The first workspace is imported
# from the WORKSPACE file, the other two from a function in a .bzl file.
#
# In this case, the overriding silently fails, and the first instance wins.
